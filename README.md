# Car-Price-Prediction
 Predicting Car Prices
This project focuses on using different attributes about cars and then predicts the price of the vehicle

I created this project using pythin in VS Code

I created one bar graph that outlines the first standard deviations on both sides, outlines the mean and median and also highlighted the area between the standard deviations.

I also created a correlation heatmap showing the correlation between all the different features of the dataset.

I then separated the train and test values and created a pipeline.
I ran a decision tree regressor, logistic regressor, linear regression and bagging regression model to determine which model would provide the most accurate results.

I found that the Random Forest Regressor had a train score of 98% and a test score of 96%
